# Build Inputs (All Agents)

- At build start, freeze the selected source, scripts, lockfiles and other inputs, including selected uncommitted changes. Use that immutable snapshot through packaging, verification and installation. Exclude changes added afterward until the next build; do not refresh or restart a running build to follow concurrent checkout edits. A correction to a frozen input requires a new build identity.
